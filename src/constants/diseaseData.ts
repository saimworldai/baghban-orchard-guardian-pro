  {
    disease: 'Apple Scab',
    severity: 'Moderate',
    causes: ['Fungal infection (Venturia inaequalis)', 'High humidity', 'Poor air circulation'],
    treatment: 'Apply copper-based fungicide and improve orchard ventilation. Prune affected areas and maintain proper tree spacing.'
  },
  {
    disease: 'Fire Blight',
    severity: 'Severe',
    causes: ['Bacterial infection (Erwinia amylovora)', 'Warm, wet spring weather', 'Insect carriers'],
    treatment: 'Remove infected branches by cutting at least 12 inches below visible symptoms. Sterilize pruning tools between cuts. Apply streptomycin sprays during bloom period.'
  },
  {
    disease: 'Cedar Apple Rust',
    severity: 'Mild',
    causes: ['Fungal pathogen (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae)', 'Proximity to cedar trees', 'Spring rainfall'],
    treatment: 'Plant resistant apple varieties. Apply fungicides at bud break and during early fruit development. Remove nearby cedar trees if possible.'
  },
  {
    disease: 'Powdery Mildew',
    severity: 'Moderate',
    causes: ['Fungal infection (Podosphaera leucotricha)', 'High humidity with moderate temperatures', 'Poor air circulation'],
    treatment: 'Apply sulfur-based fungicides at first sign of infection. Increase spacing between trees. Prune to improve air circulation.'
  },
  {
    disease: 'Sooty Blotch',
    severity: 'Mild',
    causes: ['Fungal complex', 'Long periods of high humidity', 'Rainy seasons'],
    treatment: 'Apply fungicides during fruit development. Thin fruit to improve air circulation. Prune trees to open canopy.'
  },
  {
    disease: 'Winter Canker',
    severity: 'Severe',
    causes: ['Fungal infection (Neonectria ditissima)', 'Frost damage', 'Winter wounds', 'Cold stress'],
    treatment: 'Prune out infected branches during dormancy. Apply copper-based fungicide before winter. Protect bark from frost cracks with whitewash.'
  },
  {
    disease: 'Frost Damage',
    severity: 'Severe',
    causes: ['Extreme cold temperatures', 'Sudden temperature drops', 'Poor cold hardening'],
    treatment: 'Apply anti-frost sprays. Use smudge pots or heaters during critical frost nights. Ensure proper irrigation before freeze events.'
  },
  {
    disease: 'Snow Mold',
    severity: 'Moderate',
    causes: ['Prolonged snow cover', 'Fungal growth under snow', 'Poor drainage'],
    treatment: 'Ensure good drainage around trees. Remove excess snow accumulation. Apply fungicides before heavy snowfall expected.'
  },
  {
    disease: 'Winter Sun Scald',
    severity: 'Moderate',
    causes: ['South-facing bark exposure', 'Day-night temperature fluctuations', 'Thin bark'],
    treatment: 'Paint tree trunks with white latex paint. Wrap young tree trunks with protective material. Provide partial shading.'
  },
  {
    disease: 'Root Freezing',
    severity: 'Severe',
    causes: ['Shallow root systems', 'Lack of snow cover', 'Extreme cold soil temperatures'],
    treatment: 'Apply heavy mulch around base in late autumn. Ensure adequate soil moisture before freeze. Use windbreaks to trap snow.'
